# MASTERZ WEB3 TECH MANAGER HOMEWORKS


In the **Homework.js** file, the code loops through an array composed by the days of the week and, based on the rules, one apple is eaten every day, shows the number of apples still available and doesn't eat apples on some specific days



With the **ERC20.sol** contract, I created a fungible ERC20 token, called TKTK which was deployed on AMOY Testnet.
This contract implements the basic functions for an ERC20 token, with a total supply of 100 TKTK

You can view the smart contrat at the following link on **AMOY blockchain explorer**:

With the **ERC721.sol** contract, I created two ERC721 tokens, one called "Ny First NFT" the other one called "Loading complete", deployed on Matic's Amoy Testnet.
The main difference between the two tokens is that for "Loading complete", the json file linked to that NFT was integrated with all the necessary information and data structure in order for it to be correctly displayed on Opensea.

With the **ERC1155.sol** contract called GameElements, I created the My Game Assets collection both **fungible-like** and **non fungible-like** tokens. I thought of having to create tokens for a videogame, with in-game money represented by the Gold and silver tokens that each have a 100 total supply, and a Shield and Sword token, which are unique (basically non fungible) tokens, as if they were legendary elements of the game.

# SMART-CONTRACTS


With the **ERC20.sol** contract, I created a fungible ERC20 token, called TKTK which was deployed on AMOY Testnet.
This contract implements the basic functions for an ERC20 token, with a total supply of 100 TKTK

With the **ERC721.sol** contract, I created two ERC721 tokens, one called "Ny First NFT" the other one called "Loading complete", deployed on Matic's Amoy Testnet.
The main difference between the two tokens is that for "Loading complete", the json file linked to that NFT was integrated with all the necessary information and data structure in order for it to be correctly displayed on Opensea.

With the **ERC1155.sol** contract, I created the MyGameAssetsboth **fungible-like** and **non fungible-like** tokens. I imagined of having to create tokens for a videogame, with in-game money represented by the gold and silver tokens that each have a 100 total supply, and a Shield and Sword token, which are unique tokens, as if they were a legendary element of the game.

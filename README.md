# SMART-CONTRACTS

Nel file ERC20.sol ho creato un token ERC20 chiamato MyToken (TKTK), deployed su Testnet Mumbai di Matic

Lo smart contract Ã¨ visulizzabile al seguente indirizzo:

With the **ERC721.sol** contract, I created two ERC721 tokens, one called "Ny First NFT" the other one called "Loading complete", deployed on Matic's Amoy Testnet.
The main difference between the two tokens is that for "Loading complete", the json file linked to that NFT was integrated with all the necessary information and data structure in order for it to be correctly displayed on Opensea.

You can view the smart contract on **AMOY blockchain explorer** at the following link:
